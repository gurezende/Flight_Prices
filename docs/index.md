## Problem and Description

This project was created to fulfill the problem of getting flight ticket prices on a weekly basis for a future study about how the prices behave thoughout an year.

So, the scripts will:

1. Navigate to the airline company website and get flight ticket fares for the given date.
2.  Scrape the results
    * This was accomplished with `Selenium`.    
3. Parse departure and arrival city, time and date, flight length, number of stops and ticket price.
    * Done with `BeautifulSoup`.
4. Store the structured data in a SQL DB
    * Stored in `SQLite 3`.
5. Send a message via WhatsApp with the flight with the lowest price and the average price of the flights for that date.
    * Done with `pywhatkit`.
